GRADE NOW: (Yes if final submission. Will not submit late)

1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?
Test every set method to make sure what is being passed isn't bad data. 
Test to make sure the right items were being renewed. 
Test to make sure that exceptions were being thrown.  

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?
   I did not anticipate how the exceptions flowed through the code. 
   I'd get an exception and think it was in Anytown, but it was 
   actually occuring in one of the media classes. 
   I learned a lot about how the code is executed. 
   I had to handle null first, or else I'd get nullpointer
   then I had to handle illegal arguements last or any
   code below it wouldn't execute. 
   
   I also had a hard time with checking the string for special characters
   I had to research a lot to find a method that worked without turning
   the string into a char Array and looping through. I thought there would 
   be a simple method. Please let me know if you have one. 
	
3.  What would you do differently next time?
I think I would save some time if I started out with a better
idea of the order in which I needed to write the code. I really liked
this lab better than the first one. It definitely demonstrated the point
of reducing code. Although I tried to find ways to type less, I think there are
still ways in which I could better set up the code.
